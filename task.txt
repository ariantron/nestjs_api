Backend Task (3-4 hours)
The task is to create a simple REST application from scratch. To reduce implementation time, please use the NestJS framework (this is a MUST, don’t use any other framework). The application should implement a nodeJS server API communicating with this: https://reqres.in/

Use prerequisites below:
- use TypeScript 3.4 and above. 
- use NestJS Framework, https://docs.nestjs.com/ 
- use MongoDB 4.4 and above 
- use RabbitMQ 3.7 and above

The REST app should consist of:
1. POST /api/users
On the request store the user entry in db. After the creation, send an email and rabbit event. Both can be dummy sending (no consumer needed).
2. GET /api/user/{userId}
Retrieves data from https://reqres.in/api/users/{userId} and returns a user in JSON representation.
3. GET /api/user/{userId}/avatar
Retrieves image by 'avatar' URL.
On the first request it should save the image as a plain file, stored as a mongodb entry with userId and hash. Return its base64-encoded representation.
On following requests should return the previously saved file in base64-encoded. representation (retrieve from db).
4. DELETE /api/user/{userId}/avatar
Removes the file from the FileSystem storage.
Removes the stored entry from db.


The main goal of the task is to show your skills in the best way possible.

Done?
1. Your project passes eslint
2. The project builds and can start
3. All endpoints can be requested from postman
4. Data is stored in database successfully and rabbit event is emitted
5. Your application is covered with unit/functional tests


Once the task is completed, compress the files/folder as a .zip (exclude node_modules) file and share it with HR. In addition, provide readme.md with instructions on how to build/run/test..
